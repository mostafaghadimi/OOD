# Behavioral vs Structural Diagrams

**Structure** diagrams depict the `static` structure of the elements in your system. It shows the things in the system - classes, objects, packages or modules, physical nodes, components and interfaces. They also show the relationships between these things - classes that inherit from other classes, objects that own other objects, what classes belong to what packages, what nodes are connected to each other.

**Behavior** diagrams depict the `dynamic` behavior of the elements in your a) classifier/instance 

	b) interface/instance: separation of what it does (interface) from how it does it (implementation)
	system.
It shows how the system behaves and interacts with itself and other entities (users, other systems). They show how data moves through the system, how objects communicate with each other, how the passage of time affects the system, or what events cause the system to change internal states.

1. Specification

		Graphical and Textual Dimensions

2. Adornments

3. Common Divisions

		a) classifier/instance 

		b) interface/instance: separation of what it does (interface) from how it does it (implementation)
		

4. Extensibility Mechanisms

		a) constraints

		b) stereotypes
		
		c) tagged values

		d) UML Profile

	question: what are stereotypes?!

**Meta Model**: A model of modeling element and a completely different level of abstraction from the usual UML system or business models. Must be kept in a separate model.
